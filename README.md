# HowToUseJuliaWithVSCode

## Shell
It is very useful to have Julia run on Windows within the Git `bash`. This provides a fully functioning shell environment (as opposed to the powershell or the CMD). The settings to achieve this are shown in the batch file `vscode.bat` and the `settings.json` file.

Visual Studio Code may be started either by double-clicking the batch file `vscode.bat`, or by running a little shell script in the `bash`:
```
$ cat ./code
"C:\Users\PKrysl\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe"
```
